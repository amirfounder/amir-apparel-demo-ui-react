# Developer Notes

My motivation for this project was to build a UI so I can have a base design for frontend projects.
This project includes basic features such as pagination, filtering, validation, and scss. Included frameworks / libraries:

- Sass
- React
- React Router

## Challenges

- Pagination function
- Updating the filters URL query from multiple components
- So much testing copy pasta. We should make some code generators for this.

## Lessons

- Why creating service files is so crucial (thanks to jest testing)
- Componentizing different parts of your app for reusability and testing

## Inspiration
